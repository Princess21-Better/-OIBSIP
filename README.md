üìä Oasis Internship Projects: Wine Analysis, Housing Prediction & Data Cleaning

This repository contains the practical projects I worked on during my internship at Oasis Afrobyte, 
where I applied core data analysis skills to solve real-world problems.

üîç Projects Covered:
Housing Price Prediction
Worked on a regression problem to predict house prices based on various features. 
Performed feature selection, handled missing data, and built predictive models using Scikit-learn.

Wine Quality Analysis
Explored a wine dataset to identify factors that influence wine quality.
Cleaned and visualized data using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, and built a classification model to predict wine ratings.

Data Cleaning Techniques
Focused on cleaning messy datasets, dealing with null values, duplicates, outliers, 
and incorrect data types to prepare data for further analysis or machine learning tasks.

üîß Tools & Technologies:
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook

This project in this repo reflects my hands-on experience and growth as a data analyst, with a focus on extracting insights, 
preparing data, and building accurate models. Feel free to explore the notebooks to see my workflow and thought process!
